                    Our goal is that every guest feels taken care of, both for hospitality and safety.
                    You will find the people working here positive and open minded, and ready to give of themselves for you as a guest to get the best experience.
                    To achieve this, we are thorough when choosing our crew.
                     Guides and other employees undergo solid training in what it means to be part of the Go Rafting DRY OAR team as hosts. 
                    This applies to everything from safety, overall thinking and guest care.
